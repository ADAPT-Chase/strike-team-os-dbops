# Project: Service Verification Audit

## Status: In Progress
**Started**: 2025-09-23 10:45 MST
**Lead**: Cassandra
**Priority**: High

## Overview
Comprehensive audit of database infrastructure to identify actual running services vs fabricated/non-functional installations.

## Key Findings

### Services Actually Running (5/13)
1. **PostgreSQL** - System service, fully operational
2. **Redis Cluster** - 3 nodes running on ports 18010-18012
3. **Dragonfly** - Running on port 18000
4. **Qdrant** - Partially running, shows restart activity
5. **MinIO** - Port conflict preventing startup

### Services Not Running (8/13)
- Elasticsearch (installed but not started)
- InfluxDB (empty directories)
- IPFS (binary exists but not running)
- JanusGraph (installed but not started)
- Kafka (installed but not started)
- MongoDB (config exists but not running)
- NATS (binary exists but not running)
- Neo4j (empty directories)
- TimescaleDB (extension in PostgreSQL, but standalone not running)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Resolve MinIO port conflict
- [ ] Verify which services should actually be running
- [ ] Clean up unused installations
- [ ] Establish proper service monitoring
- [ ] Create startup scripts for required services

## Impact
- Exposed significant gap between intended and actual infrastructure
- Identified potential security risks from unused binaries
- Established baseline for infrastructure improvement
